    "**Few-shot learning** is a remarkable ability that allows LLMs to learn and generalize from limited examples. Prompts serve as the input to these models and play a crucial role in achieving this feature. With LangChain, examples can be hard-coded, but dynamically selecting them often proves more powerful, enabling LLMs to adapt and tackle tasks with minimal training data swiftly.\n",

    "This approach involves using the FewShotPromptTemplate class, which takes in a PromptTemplate and a list of a few shot examples. The class formats the prompt template with a few shot examples, which helps the language model generate a better response. We can streamline this process by utilizing LangChain's FewShotPromptTemplate to structure the approach:"
